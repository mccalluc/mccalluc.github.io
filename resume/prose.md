Promoted the use of software engineering practices across the consortium, including code reviews, automated testing, and dev-ops.
Managed issue backlogs, and presented sprint summaries. Initial author of [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io), which repurposed a geospatial library (Deck.gl) for interactive visualizations of spatial single-cell data.
Delivered Docker containers for multiple projects, and from 2016-2019, managed database migrations with Django ORM, and deployment to AWS with Terraform.

creating EC2 instances and managing green/blue deployments across load balancers.

**Project Programmer, FilteredPush, Harvard Herbaria, Cambridge, Massachusetts
(August 2013–July 2014, funded for one year)**: Conceived and built a configurable
scriptlet generator to simplify “copy cataloging” workflows, particularly in natural
history collections. Used HTML5 Web Messaging API and jQuery on the client side,

[jove.com](http://jove.com) using MVC principles and object-oriented PHP.
Wrote deployment scripts and
created a test suite ranging from fine-grained unit tests to end-to-end
transactions. Implemented free-text search, replaced video player,
managed transition to a new CDN, and planned for transition from
Windows/SQLServer to Linux/MySQL. Built an administrative interface using the
Propel ORM library, HTML5 File and History APIs, jQuery, and the SlickGrid JS
library.

As QA, identified bugs in all layers of the system, documented
reproducers, wrote JUnit tests, and confirmed fixes. As evangelist, wrote
blog posts and documentation and created demonstrations of the system. As
customer support helped users understand how the software could solve their
problems and provided feedback to developers and designers.
