title: "Chuck McCallum's resume in verse"
---

<small>(It's not too good, but still, it could be worse.)</small>

When the job search seems to be so slow,<br>
is resume in rhyme the way to go?

I've programmed java, python, xsl,<br>
and maybe keywords are the easy sell,

but life is more than punching a keyboard:<br>
I've taught, and gardened too, and found reward.

So: competent, at least, I'd hope a "yes".<br>
Perhaps a little flaky? Take your guess.

A sense of poetry? Quite clearly, "no".<br>
A work history will follow here below:

Two thousand twenty-five and twenty-four,<br>
I found myself at Harvard, an encore?

With tools for [differential privacy](https://docs.opendp.org)<br>
we minimize the details others see.

Part-time since '23, a tour guide,<br>
providing context for the [midnight ride](https://www.oldnorth.com/).

A six-month stint with Princeton's Library:<br>
some Ruby code, but short I will agree.

If you'd prefer stability instead:<br>
'16 to '21 at Harvard Med,

For [HuBMAP](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/) guided devs and the design,<br>
and kept collaborations all in line.

I mentored masters students, odd intern:<br>
as much as they, I also got to learn!

At 'GBH, Archives and Library,<br>
delivered code for the [AAPB](https://americanarchive.org/),

and with designers and department staff,<br>
shipped two other sites without a gaff.

'14, Harvard Herbaria, one year<br>
to get some data management in gear.

'11 to '13, an e-journal<br>
called [JoVE](https://www.jove.com/), with PHP and SQL.

It took a while, but paid a big tech debt,<br>
and left it better than at the outset.

Then going back as far as 2010<br>
I found myself at ITA again.

'09 at Penn I crafted a [display](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/ead/index.html),<br>
with xsl beneath to make it play.

At [ITA](https://www.itasoftware.com/), 2006 to 8,<br>
on two projects did I participate:

The first: screen scraping for semantics, light.<br>
Second, conventional, a travel site.

2005, a Lowell non-profit,<br>
the CSL: I sys-adminned, a bit.

2004, and earlier, a run<br>
of volunteering, internships. Was fun,

but hard to summarize: I'll make a try<br>
to fit it in, and not to go awry.

At [Island Press](https://islandpress.org/): wrote up an export script.<br>
(Had been by hand, and out of sync had slipped.)

Two farms, a monastery: floors to sweep,<br>
gardens to weed, and herds of cows and sheep.

At Carter's presidential library:<br>
scanned papers so the data could be free.

Missoula, U of M: some book repair,<br>
end papers, boxes, bindings, and that fare.

At College Park (a different U of M):<br>
time teaching GIS, and tutoring them.

At NPR, the library's ref desk:<br>
I cataloged, and hunted down requests.

2005, an MLS from U<br>
of Maryland. In '99, a few

years farther back, a math/geology<br>
BA from Carleton was my first degree.

Of acronyms, there always is one more,<br>
but fitting it in meter is the chore.
