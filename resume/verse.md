title: A resume in verse: You could do worse?
---

When the job search seems to be so slow,<br>
is resume in rhyme the way to go?

I've programmed java, python, xsl,<br>
and maybe keywords are the easy sell,

but life is more than punching a keyboard:<br>
I've taught, and gardened too, and found reward.

So: competent, at least, I'd hope a "yes".<br>
Perhaps a little flaky? Take your guess.

A sense of poetry? Quite clearly, "no".<br>
A work history can follow here below:

'14 at the Harvard Herbaria:<br>
Software to catalog all the flora.

'11 to '13, an e-journal<br>
called JoVE, with PHP and SQL.

It took a while, but paid a big a big tech debt,<br>
and left it better than at the outset.

2010, and yet a season more:<br>
was back at ITA for an encore.

2009, the library at Penn:<br>
I long had planned to be librarian,

and this, though temporary, seemed a fit,<br>
between the IT skills, and love of lit.

In xsl I crafted a display,<br>
with java underneath to make it play.

At ITA, 2006 to 8,<br>
on two projects did I participate:

The first: screen scraping for semantics, light.<br>
Second, conventional, a travel site.

2005, a Lowell non-profit,<br>
the CSL: I sys-adminned, a bit.

2004, and earlier, a run<br>
of volunteering, internships. Was fun,

but hard to summarize: I'll make a try<br>
to fit it in, and not to go awry.

At Island Press: wrote up an export script.<br>
(Had been by hand, and out of sync had slipped.)

Two farms, a monastery: floors to sweep,<br>
gardens to weed, and herds of cows and sheep.

At Carter's presidential library:<br>
scanned papers so the data could be free.

Missoula, U of M: some book repair,<br>
end papers, boxes, bindings, and that fare.

At College Park (a different U of M):<br>
time teaching GIS, and tutoring them.

At NPR, the library's ref desk:<br>
I cataloged, and hunted down requests.

2005, an MLS from U<br>
of Maryland. In '99, a few

years farther back, a math/geology<br>
BA from Carleton was my first degree.

Of acronyms, there always is one more,<br>
but fitting it in meter is the chore.
