DP Wizard:

  github: https://github.com/opendp/dp-wizard
  about: |
    DP Wizard makes it easier to get started with differential privacy.
    You can run DP Wizard locally and upload your own CSV, or use the cloud deployment and only provide column names to protect your private data. In either case, you'll be prompted to describe your privacy budget and the analysis you need. With that information, DP Wizard provides a Jupyter notebook which demonstrates how to use the OpenDP Library, a plain Python script, and text and CSV reports.
